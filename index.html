        <h2>Hi There,</h2>
        <h2>I'm Gulmina Ayaz</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website. Hello, I am Gulmina Ayaz. I am a full-stack Web developer passionate about providing excellent solutions to complex problems. 

            My background in computer science led me to a full-stack web development boot camp, where I gained knowledge of JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more. As a result of these skills, I have been able to apply them in projects such as JourneyPack, an AI-powered e-commerce platform.
            
            As a web developer, I specialize in turning client ideas into reality through exceptional web applications. My main passion is technology. I am an avid learner and I thrive in a team-oriented, agile environment. In the end, my goal is to create products that exceed expectations not only in terms of quality but also in terms of functionality</p>
